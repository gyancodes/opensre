"""Domain envelope for pipeline streaming events.

``StreamEvent`` is the inter-layer event shape produced by the
orchestration pipeline (node updates + fine-grained chain/tool/LLM
callbacks) and consumed by the CLI renderer, the remote runner, and
any future surface that observes pipeline progress.

It deliberately lives in ``core.domain`` so that the orchestration
core does not need to import from ``infra.deployment.remote`` (a transport-layer
package). The SSE parser that materializes ``StreamEvent``s from a
remote HTTP response stays in ``infra.deployment.remote.stream``; the event shape
itself is domain.
