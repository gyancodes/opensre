"""Per-turn immutable context snapshot for the interactive-shell agent.

Assembled once at the start of each turn from the live ``ReplSession``.
All fields reflect session state at turn-start and do not change while the
turn runs, so downstream code reads a stable snapshot rather than a live,
concurrently-mutated object.

Usage::

    turn_ctx = TurnContext.from_session(text, session)
    # pass turn_ctx to action agent + conversational assistant
    # keep passing session for writes (recording history, token usage, etc.)
