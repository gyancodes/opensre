"""Conversational assistant prompt construction for the interactive OpenSRE shell.

Builds the full docs-aware assistant prompt from grounding sources, prior
investigation state, environment facts, synthetic-run observations, and recent
conversation history. The turn runtime (``harness/agent.py``) calls
``build_cli_agent_prompt`` and stays out of the business of assembling prompt
text.

Prompt blocks are composed from typed :class:`PromptSection` values via
``render_sections`` so the exact ``--- label ---`` spacing lives in one place;
free-form framing blocks (observation, integration guard, synthetic failure)
stay as small pure ``-> str`` builders because their bodies are bespoke prose.
