"""Shared base for interactive-shell grounding references.

A grounding reference owns a cache of some corpus (CLI help, docs, AGENTS.md)
and renders it into prompt text. Every reference exposes the same diagnostics
surface (``name``, ``stats() -> CacheStats``, ``invalidate()``), so the single
``as_grounding_source()`` adapter lives here instead of being copy-pasted into
each concrete reference. ``build_text`` stays per-class because its signature
varies (the docs reference takes a query; the others take none).
